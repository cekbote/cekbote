<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Chanakya</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate Machine Learning Researcher from India</h3>

I am an incoming Masters Student and Research Scholar at Ã‰cole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL). Prior to this, I spent two fantastic years at Microsoft Research India (MSR) as a predoctoral research fellow, advised by Arun Iyer and Sundarajan Sellamanickam. During my time at MSR, I focused on research that combined machine learning and graphs, working on problems related to supervised and unsupervised representation learning on graphs, spectral graph theory, and multi-behavior recommendation systems. My primary interest lies in developing algorithmic and theoretical tools to enhance our understanding of machine learning and make it more robust and practical, especially in the context of graph data.

In the past, I have worked on various topics at different institutions, including the Mila - Quebec AI Institute, Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), S20.AI, and as a Google Scholar Developer. I completed my undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar in 2021.
When not staring at code, you can find me either on a basketball court, going for a run, playing the piano, or enjoying hikes. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss any of the above. I'm open to all kinds of potential collaborations and conversations, be it discussions on representation learning theory to why I believe Jordan is the GOAT :).

P.S. I am on the lookout for Ph.D. / research positions, both in industry and academia.

I am a final year undergrad at IIT Bhubaneswar, passionate about machine learning, data science, and contributing to open source. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Student Developer, during the summer of 2020, to combine Machine Learning and Cybersecurity as a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). You can learn more about my project [here](https://mlbridge.github.io/). I have also worked as a research intern at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (in Reinforcement Learning).
