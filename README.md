# Hey, I'm Chanakya :wave:

I am a final year undergrad at IIT Bhubaneswar, passionate about machine learning, data science, and contributing to open source. I worked as a Google Summer of Code Student Developer, during the summer of 2020, to combine Machine Learning and Cybersecurity as a part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). You can learn more about my project [here](https://mlbridge.github.io/). I have also worked as a research intern at Freie Universitat, Berlin and at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.
